== Description ==

This plugin allows you to see how long it took your WordPress page to execute from your server. This is helpful for optimizing your WordPress installation, caching, your web server, and your server-side scripting code like your PHP and database queries. This does not test client-side code like your JavaScript or jQuery.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-page-speed-test` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently asked questions ==
* Where can I see my page speed?
On any page loaded while this plugin is active, you may right-click your page, click "View Source" and find the page load speed at the bottom of the page.
